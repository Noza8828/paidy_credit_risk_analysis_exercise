# Paidy Credit Risk Analysis

Comprehensive analysis of consumer credit data to predict delinquency and provide risk management recommendations.

## Project Overview

This analysis addresses the Paidy Risk Exercise requirements by answering four key questions:

1. What can you tell us about the population of consumers?
2. What insights can you draw from the data?
3. How can we use this data to predict that a consumer might not pay?
4. What are some recommendations you can make to manage the risk of these consumers?
